# ViZDoom Benchmark

This independent distribution exposes the 12 standard ViZDoom 1.3.0 scenarios
whose WAD/config assets ship in the upstream wheel. The Host fixes one
`ViZDoomConfig.profile` per Run.

```python
from vizdoom_benchmarks import ViZDoomBenchmark, ViZDoomConfig

benchmark = ViZDoomBenchmark(ViZDoomConfig(profile="deadly-corridor"))
```

RGB frames, game variables, optional audio, and notifications cross the Policy
boundary only as bounded values and canonical tensors. Most profiles use a
strict discrete action. Deathmatch uses a strict object containing one discrete
binary-button selection and three continuous delta controls.

The primary metric is mean return. Feedback includes bounded per-Episode
summaries and a diagnostic trace covering at most 32 steps in each of four
Episodes. Long Episodes retain their first and last steps, bounded samples of
reward and game-variable-change events, and an even timeline sample. Selected
screen frames, game variables, and optional audio are stored losslessly in
compressed NPZ artifacts; optional notifications remain inline. PNG contact
sheets cover traced Episodes, while every Episode publishes its own bounded
animated GIF replay exposing the visual trajectory, action meaning, reward, and
primary game variables. Omitted trace Episodes and steps plus sampled replay
frames are reported explicitly; the Kernel-owned `feedback.json` retains every
Episode result without seeds, paths, or WAD identity.

Commercial Doom/Doom2 map registrations are intentionally excluded because
their WADs do not ship with ViZDoom. FreeDoom campaign maps can be added as a
separate suite if desired.
