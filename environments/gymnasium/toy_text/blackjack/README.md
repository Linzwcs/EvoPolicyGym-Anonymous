# EvoPolicyGym Blackjack Benchmark

This independently installable distribution adapts Gymnasium `Blackjack-v1`
through EvoPolicyGym's public authoring SPI. Each Episode is one
infinite-deck Blackjack hand.

## Public interface

```python
from blackjack import (
    BlackjackBenchmark,
    BlackjackConfig,
    baseline_program,
)

benchmark = BlackjackBenchmark(
    BlackjackConfig(natural=False, sab=True)
)
```

The default matches the Gymnasium 1.3.0 `Blackjack-v1` registration.
`BlackjackConfig` publishes the `natural` and `sab` rule switches through
`BenchmarkSpec.environment_parameters`; they contribute to
`environment_digest` and are delivered to every Policy. When `sab=True`,
Gymnasium ignores the `natural` bonus and applies the Sutton-and-Barto natural
rule. The public parameters also include the exact card-value distribution,
ace semantics, dealer threshold, payouts, initial card counts, and horizon.

## Contract

The positional Gymnasium tuple is converted into a semantic observation:

```json
{
  "player_sum": 16,
  "dealer_showing": 10,
  "usable_ace": false
}
```

Action `0` sticks and Action `1` hits. Actions must be exact integers;
booleans, floats, structured values, and out-of-range integers raise
`InvalidAction`.

Cards are drawn with replacement from:

```text
A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K
```

Face cards each have value 10. The dealer draws until reaching at least 17.
A win returns `+1`, a draw `0`, and a loss `-1`. When `sab=False` and
`natural=True`, a winning natural pays `+1.5`.

The terminal observation after a hit can contain player sums 22-31. Feedback
classifies a hit as `hit_continue` or `hit_bust` and reports every card value
consistent with the visible before/after state. This is derived only from the
public sum and usable-ace flag; dealer hole cards and dealer final hands remain
private.

The scalar Benchmark score is mean terminal reward. Blackjack has high
per-hand variance, so useful comparisons should evaluate many Episodes.
Policy failure receives `-1`, equal to the minimum complete hand return.

Gymnasium defines no TimeLimit for this environment. The Benchmark declares a
32-action safety horizon and the adapter enforces it, although positive card
values make valid hit/stick play terminate naturally well before it.

## Feedback and trace

Feedback reports mean reward, mean actions per hand, wins, draws, losses,
initial player naturals, hit/stick event counts, incomplete hands, Policy
failures, and bounded trace coverage. `trace.jsonl` retains at most 32 complete
hands with every semantic observation seen by the Policy, named unmodified
Actions, rewards, termination flags, player-sum and usable-ace changes,
publicly inferable drawn-card values, event classification, and terminal
reason.

Environment seeds, Policy seeds, Host paths, credentials, dealer hole cards,
and private runtime evidence are never published.

`baseline_program()` always sticks immediately. It is intentionally weak and
leaves hand strategy to the coding agent.

## Development

From the repository root:

```console
cd environments/gymnasium/toy_text/blackjack
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv build .
```

`ProcessExecution` used by Evaluation tests is explicitly unsafe and provides
no isolation. The packaged baseline is trusted test code.
