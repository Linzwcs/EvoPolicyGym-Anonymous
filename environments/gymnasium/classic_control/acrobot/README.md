# EvoPolicyGym Acrobot Benchmark

This directory contains the independently installable Acrobot Benchmark for
EvoPolicyGym. It adapts Gymnasium `Acrobot-v1` through the public
EvoPolicyGym authoring SPI.

The Benchmark contract is:

- one semantic observation dictionary containing six named finite floats: the
  sine and cosine of both joint angles and both angular velocities;
- three exact integer Actions: `0`, `1`, and `2`, applying negative, zero, and
  positive torque;
- one complete Gymnasium Episode with a 500-step hard horizon;
- deterministic, split-scoped hidden environment seeds;
- mean Episode return as the scalar score;
- `-500` return for a Policy failure, matching the minimum complete Episode
  return so invalid code cannot outperform a valid Policy.

Gymnasium assigns `-1` to every non-terminal step and `0` to the successful
terminal step. Higher scores therefore mean reaching the target in fewer
steps. The official task contract is documented in the
[Gymnasium Acrobot reference](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/acrobot/).

`theta1` is measured from the downward direction and `theta2` is relative to
the first link. With one-meter links, the public success condition is
`-cos(theta1) - cos(theta1 + theta2) > 1`. Actions apply `-1`, `0`, or `+1`
N·m at the middle joint. The specification publishes this formula, units,
0.2-second RK4 integration, book dynamics, physical constants, initial-state
sampling, velocity bounds, rewards, and 500-step horizon.

## Public interface

```python
from acrobot import AcrobotBenchmark, baseline_program
```

`AcrobotBenchmark` owns the public specification, deterministic Episode
planning, fresh Environment construction, scoring, Feedback, and trace
publication. `baseline_program()` returns an intentionally weak zero-torque
Policy suitable as the starting point for development Runs.

Actions are never clipped, cast, or replaced. Booleans, floats, out-of-range
integers, and structured values raise `InvalidAction`.

The Benchmark adapter converts Gymnasium's positional array into:

```json
{
  "cos_theta_1": 0.998,
  "sin_theta_1": -0.062,
  "cos_theta_2": 1.000,
  "sin_theta_2": -0.009,
  "theta_1_angular_velocity": -0.100,
  "theta_2_angular_velocity": 0.031
}
```

The names are part of the Benchmark contract. A Policy does not need to infer
the Gymnasium array order.

## Feedback and trace

Feedback reports mean return, mean Episode length, successful and time-limit
Episodes, mean and overall best free-end height, closest target gap, Policy
failures, and bounded trace coverage. The public `trace.jsonl` artifact retains
at most eight Episodes. It contains the observations seen by the Policy, named
unmodified Actions, torque, reconstructed absolute and relative angles,
angular velocities, link and free-end heights, target margin, elapsed simulated
time, rewards, next observations, termination flags, and terminal reason.

Environment seeds, Policy seeds, Host paths, credentials, and private runtime
evidence are never published.

## Development

From the repository root:

```console
cd environments/gymnasium/classic_control/acrobot
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv build .
```

`ProcessExecution` used by the Evaluation test is explicitly unsafe and
provides no isolation. The packaged baseline is trusted test code.
