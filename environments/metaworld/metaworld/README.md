# MetaWorld Benchmark

This independent distribution exposes MetaWorld 3.1.1 multi-task benchmarks
through EvoPolicyGym's single-Policy authoring surface.

`MetaWorldConfig.profile` accepts any of the 50 canonical `*-v3` task names for
MT1, plus `mt10`, `mt50`, or `custom`. A custom profile requires a fixed tuple
of canonical task names:

```python
from metaworld_benchmarks import MetaWorldBenchmark, MetaWorldConfig

mt1 = MetaWorldBenchmark(MetaWorldConfig(profile="assembly-v3"))
mt10 = MetaWorldBenchmark(MetaWorldConfig(profile="mt10"))
custom = MetaWorldBenchmark(
    MetaWorldConfig(
        profile="custom",
        custom_tasks=("reach-v3", "push-v3", "door-open-v3"),
    )
)
```

The Host fixes the task collection for a Run and chooses the concrete task for
each Episode. MT1 observations are canonical 39-element `float64`
`TensorValue`s. MT10, MT50, and custom observations add a public one-hot task
tensor with a public index-to-task mapping in the environment parameters.
The public parameters explicitly document that `TensorValue` is not iterable
and show the packed little-endian `float64` decoding pattern for Policies.
Run-visible traces retain only the Policy-visible state and task one-hot; they
never include Episode seeds, Host scenarios, or other private Case identity.

The primary metric is mean Episode return from MetaWorld's upstream dense
reward. Success rate remains a separately reported task-completion outcome.
Public reward-component traces provide intermediate optimization feedback. Current values, per-step
changes, and Episode-best values are reported for reach/contact, grasp,
in-place progress, object-to-target distance, and dense reward. Feedback also
distinguishes current versus ever-achieved success/grasp, first achievement,
later regression, action magnitude/saturation, state motion, and per-task
success/return for MT collections. Each traced transition
contains the Policy-visible observation, Action, reward, next observation, and
public metrics. Episodes longer than 160 steps retain the first 128 and final 32
steps, with retained and omitted counts reported explicitly. ML1/ML10/ML45 are
reserved until the Kernel has an explicit Trial abstraction.

Every Episode with at least one valid transition also preserves every captured
128x128 frame from the versioned `overview-v1` MuJoCo free camera losslessly in
`rendered-frames.npz`, together with step indices, rewards, reward presence,
and cumulative returns. A bounded animated GIF is derived from the same frames
for convenient inspection; it is not the sole visual evidence. The Host
captures the initial state, first result, terminal result, and an adaptive
stride of intermediate results, with at most 42 frames per Episode. Raw RGB
values exist in Host-side Step metrics during evaluation, are removed from
JSONL traces, and never become Policy observations. The lossless frame
evidence and derived GIF use `retention="bulk"`. Each manifest states whether
capture is complete for the configured sampling schedule and whether it covers
every Episode step.

`overview-v1` is fixed at look-at `(0.0, 0.65, 0.12)`, distance `1.35`,
azimuth `160`, and elevation `-22` degrees. These camera parameters are part of
the public Environment identity so visual evidence remains comparable across
Runs.

Feedback includes one visual-evidence manifest for every Episode. A zero-step Policy
failure has no public post-reset artifact channel, so it is retained as an
explicit unavailable visual-evidence result rather than being silently omitted. Episode
seeds and private scenario identity never cross the Policy boundary.
