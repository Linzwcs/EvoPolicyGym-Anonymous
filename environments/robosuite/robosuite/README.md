# EvoPolicyGym robosuite Benchmark

This independent distribution exposes all 19 environments registered by
robosuite 1.5.2 through EvoPolicyGym's public authoring API.

`RobosuiteConfig.profile` selects one fixed task for a Run. Single-arm tasks
use one Panda; two-arm tasks use two opposed Pandas. All profiles use the
upstream BASIC composite controller with OSC pose control, state observations,
upstream dense shaping where implemented, and mean-return scoring. Success
rate remains a separately reported task-completion outcome.

```python
from robosuite_benchmarks import RobosuiteBenchmark, RobosuiteConfig

benchmark = RobosuiteBenchmark(
    RobosuiteConfig(profile="lift", max_episode_steps=500)
)
```

## Profiles

- Lift, Stack, Door, Wipe, and ToolHang;
- NutAssembly plus Single, Square, and Round variants;
- PickPlace plus Single, Milk, Bread, Cereal, and Can variants;
- TwoArmLift, TwoArmPegInHole, TwoArmHandover, and TwoArmTransport.

The Policy observation contains two canonical `float64` tensors:
`proprioception` concatenates the upstream per-robot proprioceptive state and
`objects` contains the task's public object state. Camera frames, simulator
objects, Host paths, seeds, and raw Case identity never cross the Policy
boundary. The packaged baseline demonstrates how to decode the tensor bytes
with `struct.iter_unpack("<d", ...)`.

Actions are strict BASIC-controller vectors in `[-1, 1]`. Single-arm tasks use
six operational-space pose deltas and, where a gripper exists, one gripper
effort. Two-arm tasks concatenate one such control block per robot. Invalid
Actions are rejected without advancing MuJoCo; they are never clipped or
repaired.

An Episode succeeds if the upstream task success predicate is true on any
transition. The Environment continues until the configured horizon unless the
upstream task declares an earlier terminal condition. Feedback reports success,
dense return, first success, action magnitude/saturation, state motion, cleanup
outcomes, and bounded public transition traces. For every Episode with at
least one valid transition, it also preserves every captured 128x128
`agentview` frame losslessly in `rendered-frames.npz`. The evidence contains
frame pixels, step indices, rewards, reward presence, cumulative returns, and
the task-success state. An `agentview` replay GIF is derived from the same
frames for convenient inspection; it is not the sole visual evidence.

The camera is sampled on the initial state, step 1, a fixed stride chosen from
the configured horizon, and the terminal state, for at most 42 frames per
Episode. Short Episodes capture every step. Raw RGB values exist in Host-only
Step metrics during evaluation, are removed from the JSONL trace, and never
become Policy observations. The lossless frame evidence, derived GIF, and
reproducible trace all use `retention="bulk"`. Each visual-evidence manifest
states whether capture is complete for the configured sampling schedule and
whether it covers every Episode step.
The Kernel-owned `feedback.json` `episodes` array preserves every Episode's
status, reward, step count, and Policy failure without summary truncation. A
zero-step Policy failure is recorded there with an explicit unavailable
visual-evidence manifest because the public Environment SPI has no post-reset
artifact channel.

Camera capture is diagnostic evidence and is fail-soft: a missing offscreen GL
backend is reported in Feedback without changing the physics Episode or score.
On macOS the adapter uses MuJoCo's native CGL renderer rather than robosuite
1.5.2's GLFW offscreen wrapper. Headless Linux deployments should provision a
working MuJoCo EGL or OSMesa profile.

## Runtime pin

The distribution pins `robosuite==1.5.2` and the independently tested
`mujoco>=3.3,<3.4` ABI. Current unconstrained resolution reaches MuJoCo 3.11,
which removed the `MjData.qM` attribute still used by robosuite 1.5.2's
operational-space controller and prevents every task from constructing. This
pin should be revisited when robosuite adopts the current API.

## Development

```console
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ruff check src tests scripts
uv run mypy --no-incremental
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv build
```

The optional Luna end-to-end check uses the explicitly unsafe local process
execution profile:

```console
uv run python scripts/run_robosuite_codex.py \
  --record-to /private/tmp/robosuite-lift-luna \
  --model gpt-5.6-luna \
  --reasoning-effort high \
  --allow-unsafe-process
```

`ProcessExecution` is not a sandbox. Run the command only with trusted Agent
and Policy code. A short record path avoids the macOS Unix-domain socket limit;
move the closed Run record under the repository's `runs/` directory afterward.
