# Environment integration status

This ledger covers the planned environment expansion. “Integrated” means an
independently installable Benchmark distribution exists, uses only the public
authoring SPI, owns a lockfile and tests, and has passed either a real upstream
`reset()`/`step()` smoke test or rules-conformance tests for an independent
simulator. “Deferred” means the requested environment requires a Kernel
capability that the current single-Policy ABI intentionally does not claim.
“Unavailable” means upstream runtime or redistributable assets are absent;
metadata-only registrations are not presented as runnable profiles.

Profiles are public, typed Benchmark configuration selected by the Host before
a Run. A selected profile is fixed for that Run, visible to the Coding Agent
and Policy through `environment_parameters`, and contributes to the
environment digest. Episode seeds and private scenario identity are not
profiles and never cross the Policy boundary.

## Deferred by an explicit Kernel boundary

| Requested environments | Required capability | Why they are not represented as single-agent profiles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MaMuJoCo | Multi-agent lifecycle and joint-action ABI | One Policy action and one observation cannot faithfully encode independently addressed agents |
| MPE2: Simple, SimpleAdversary, SimpleCrypto, SimpleFormation, SimpleLine, SimplePush, SimpleReference, SimpleSpeakerListener, SimpleSpread, SimpleTag, SimpleWorldComm, CollectTreasure | Multi-agent lifecycle and joint-action ABI | Parallel agents, per-agent observations/actions, termination, and rewards need a first-class contract |
| PettingZoo Classic: TicTacToe, ConnectFour, Chess, Go, RockPaperScissors, LeducHoldem, TexasHoldem, TexasHoldemNoLimit, GinRummy, Hanabi | AEC/parallel multi-agent ABI | Flattening turn ownership into the current action ABI would hide invalid-action and lifecycle semantics |
| PettingZoo Butterfly/SISL: CooperativePong, KnightsArchersZombies, Pistonball, Multiwalker, Pursuit | Parallel multi-agent ABI | Joint actions and per-agent termination/reward semantics are required |
| Jumanji Cleaner, Connector, MMST, MultiCVRP, RobotWarehouse, LevelBasedForaging, and SearchAndRescue | Multi-agent lifecycle and joint-action ABI | Their observations, actions, and rewards address multiple agents; flattening them into one Policy action would erase agent ownership |
| MetaWorld ML1, ML10, ML45 | Trial abstraction | Meta-learning support/query phases must not be confused with ordinary independent Episodes |
| MiniWoB++ original, no-delay, transfer, email, flight, and hidden-test suites | Whole-Run virtualization and a browser execution profile | Browser processes, web assets, and hidden server state need Host-owned lifecycle and isolation |

## Unavailable in the current portable runtime

| Requested environments | Result of integration attempt |
| --- | --- |
| Procgen's 16 games: BigFish, BossFight, CaveFlyer, Chaser, Climber, CoinRun, Dodgeball, FruitBot, Heist, Jumper, Leaper, Maze, Miner, Ninja, Plunder, and StarPilot | The currently published `procgen2` artifacts do not support this repository's Python 3.12/macOS ARM runtime (the available wheel is CPython 3.11 Linux x86-64 and no source distribution is published). Revisit with a maintained runtime or Docker execution profile. |
| Remaining ALE registrations | ALE 0.12.0 registers 104 environments, but its current wheel supplies a directly runnable ROM only for Tetris. The other 103 registrations fail without separately obtained ROMs. |
| Commercial ViZDoom maps | ViZDoom does not distribute commercial Doom/Doom II IWADs. Metadata or a Host-local WAD path is not a portable Benchmark distribution. |
| Remaining Stable-Retro integrations | Stable-Retro 1.0.1 ships 1,030 integration definitions but a redistributable ROM only for Airstriker. The other integrations require externally supplied ROMs. |
| Jumanji Sokoban | Jumanji 1.1.1 creates its default generator by downloading the Boxoban dataset from Hugging Face. It is excluded until the distribution can pin and provision that dataset without network I/O during Environment construction. |
| ManiSkill 3.0.1 | The wheel registers 74 tasks and 61 declare no additional asset downloads, but no task is runnable in this native macOS ARM Host. Both `state`/`physx_cpu` construction and the documented `render_backend="none"` path still force SAPIEN's CPU renderer; ManiSkill's Darwin `can_render()` path unconditionally creates a Vulkan `RenderSystem`, which fails here with `ErrorIncompatibleDriver` because no Vulkan/MoltenVK driver is available. No Benchmark distribution is published until a Vulkan-capable Host profile is provisioned or upstream supports a truly renderer-free CPU scene. |

## Audited future candidates

These candidates have authoritative upstreams, but are not runnable
distributions in the current native release. Each row states the concrete
condition that must change before integration.

| Candidate | Current resolution |
| --- | --- |
| [Solomon VRPTW](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/vrptw/solomon-benchmark/) | Deferred. The authoritative page does not state redistribution terms for the instance files, and a completed route file is not yet an accepted constructive Policy interaction. EdgeBench instances, hidden cases, and best-known score anchors are not substitutes for either requirement. |
| [Battle for Wesnoth](https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth) | Deferred to a pinned headless engine profile that owns the executable, Lua AI bridge, independently authored scenarios, opponent policy, timeouts, and cleanup. A Python metadata package cannot make the external game process portable. |
| [OpenTTD](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD) | Deferred to a pinned engine profile that owns the executable, base graphics, NoAI bridge, generated-map profile, long-running lifecycle, and deterministic teardown. |
| [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://github.com/crawl/crawl) | Deferred to a pinned headless engine profile and a verified supported machine-control surface. The EdgeBench Lua scaffold is not an upstream DCSS interface contract. |
| [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2) | Deferred even after an engine profile exists because ordinary play additionally depends on separately licensed RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 data files. |
| [AtCoder AHC056](https://atcoder.jp/contests/ahc056/tasks/ahc056_a) and [CodeChef TRICOL](https://www.codechef.com/problems/TRICOL) | Not admitted to the current roadmap. Their authoritative form grades a completed design, and no meaningful incremental Policy interaction has been accepted. |
| EdgeBench-only graph, permutation, SMT, and fixed text-adventure leads | Rejected until each has an independently verified authoritative upstream, redistribution rights, and a non-artificial Environment contract. Fixed commercial text worlds additionally need publisher-level distribution rights. |

Deferred and unavailable rows have been processed and intentionally skipped;
they are not compatibility promises. A future implementation should add the
missing Kernel capability or legal asset provisioning first, then introduce a
new independent distribution with its own conformance and real-environment
tests.
