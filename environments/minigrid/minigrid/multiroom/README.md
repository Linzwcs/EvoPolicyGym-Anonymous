# MiniGrid MultiRoom Benchmark

An independently installable EvoPolicyGym Benchmark for the
[MiniGrid MultiRoom](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/MultiRoomEnv/)
navigation task.

The Policy receives the upstream `7 × 7 × 3` egocentric symbolic image,
compass direction, and fixed mission. It must discover a chain of rooms, open
the connecting doors, and reach the green goal in the final room. The primary
score is mean upstream Episode return; success rate remains separately reported.

The image uses `image[view_x, view_y, channel]`: the agent is at `(3, 6)`,
forward decreases `view_y`, and right increases `view_x`. Actions `3`
(`pick_up`), `4` (`drop`), and `6` (`done`) are unused. Opening or crossing a
door is intermediate; only moving forward onto the final green goal naturally
terminates the Episode. Success reward is
`1 - 0.9 * step_count / max_episode_steps`; all other rewards are zero.

## Install and test

From the EvoPolicyGym repository root:

```console
uv sync --project environments/minigrid/minigrid/multiroom --extra dev
uv run --project environments/minigrid/minigrid/multiroom \
  python -m unittest discover \
  -s environments/minigrid/minigrid/multiroom/tests
uv build environments/minigrid/minigrid/multiroom
```

## Public API

```python
from minigrid_multiroom import (
    MultiRoomBenchmark,
    MultiRoomConfig,
    baseline_program,
)

benchmark = MultiRoomBenchmark(
    MultiRoomConfig(profile="N6-S10"),
)
program = baseline_program()
```

Available profiles are `N2-S4`, `N4-S5`, `N4-S5-v0-legacy-N6`, and
`N6-S10`. The legacy profile preserves the upstream registration whose name
says four rooms but whose configuration actually generates six. A profile is
Host-selected before a Run and contributes to the environment digest.

Feedback reports success, door and final-goal discovery steps, door-open,
door-close, and door-crossing event counts, failed toggles, blocked forward
moves, unused actions, observation novelty, ineffective actions, action mix,
return, truncation, and Policy failures. Door values deliberately count events,
not unique physical doors: only adjacent door colors are guaranteed to differ,
so a color cannot safely serve as a door identity from public observations.
`trace.jsonl` contains a bounded semantic trace for at most four Episodes,
retaining the first 128 and last 32 transitions of long Episodes. It contains
no Episode seed, private Case identity, or Host path.

The packaged baseline builds a relative map from public egocentric
observations, opens reachable doors, and shortest-path plans to the goal. It
consumes no private environment state.

Tests that use `ProcessExecution.unsafe()` run trusted packaged code only.
That backend is a local process mechanism, not a sandbox and not suitable for
hostile Programs.
