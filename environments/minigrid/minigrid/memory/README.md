# MiniGrid Memory Benchmark

An independently installable EvoPolicyGym Benchmark for the
[MiniGrid Memory](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/MemoryEnv/)
partially observable T-maze.

The Policy sees the upstream `7 × 7 × 3` egocentric symbolic image, compass
direction, and mission text. It must remember whether the green cue was a key
or a ball, walk down the corridor, and select the matching object. The primary
score is mean upstream Episode return; success rate remains separately reported.

Only `turn_left`, `turn_right`, and `move_forward` are public Actions. The
upstream environment silently rewrites its nominal `pickup` Action into
`toggle`; this adapter rejects that alias instead of publishing an inaccurate
Action meaning.

## Install and test

From the EvoPolicyGym repository root:

```console
uv sync --project environments/minigrid/minigrid/memory --extra dev
uv run --project environments/minigrid/minigrid/memory \
  python -m unittest discover \
  -s environments/minigrid/minigrid/memory/tests
uv build environments/minigrid/minigrid/memory
```

## Public API

```python
from minigrid_memory import MemoryBenchmark, MemoryConfig, baseline_program

benchmark = MemoryBenchmark(
    MemoryConfig(profile="13x13-random"),
)
program = baseline_program()
```

Available profiles are `11x11`, `13x13`, `13x13-random`, and
`17x17-random`. The default random-length profile prevents a Policy from
solving the task using one fixed action count.

The spec defines image axes and channels, view orientation, compass and object
encodings, exact reward, Action subset, and terminal conditions. Feedback
reports when green keys and balls were first observed, the first observed
green-object type, the object type selected at the terminal decision, the
current observable task stage, wrong-target choices, remaining horizon,
observation novelty, ineffective Actions, and per-Action usage. It deliberately
does not label a private hidden object as “the cue”; every diagnostic is
derived from the Policy-visible stream. `trace.jsonl` contains a bounded
semantic trace for at most four Episodes; long traces retain the first 128 and
last 32 transitions and contain no Episode seed or private Case identity.

The packaged baseline is intentionally small. It is a finite-state Policy
whose same-Episode state remembers the cue; it uses only public Policy context
and observations.

Tests that use `ProcessExecution.unsafe()` run trusted packaged code only.
That backend is a local process mechanism, not a sandbox and not suitable for
hostile Programs.
