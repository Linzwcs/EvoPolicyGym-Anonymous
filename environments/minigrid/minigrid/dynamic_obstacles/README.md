# MiniGrid DynamicObstacles Benchmark

An independently installable EvoPolicyGym Benchmark for the
[MiniGrid DynamicObstacles](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/DynamicObstaclesEnv/)
navigation task.

The Policy receives the upstream `7 × 7 × 3` egocentric symbolic image,
compass direction, and fixed mission. It must reach the green goal while grey
balls move locally before every action. The only valid actions are left,
right, and forward. The upstream environment checks the cell ahead, moves the
balls, then applies the Action; trying to move forward into any cell that was
occupied by a non-goal object ends the Episode with reward `-1`. This includes
both a grey ball and a wall. The primary score is mean upstream Episode return;
success rate remains separately reported.

## Install and test

From the EvoPolicyGym repository root:

```console
uv sync --project environments/minigrid/minigrid/dynamic_obstacles --extra dev
uv run --project environments/minigrid/minigrid/dynamic_obstacles \
  python -m unittest discover \
  -s environments/minigrid/minigrid/dynamic_obstacles/tests
uv build environments/minigrid/minigrid/dynamic_obstacles
```

## Public API

```python
from minigrid_dynamic_obstacles import (
    DynamicObstaclesBenchmark,
    DynamicObstaclesConfig,
    baseline_program,
)

benchmark = DynamicObstaclesBenchmark(
    DynamicObstaclesConfig(profile="8x8-N4"),
)
program = baseline_program()
```

Available profiles are `5x5-N2`, `5x5-N2-random`, `6x6-N3`,
`6x6-N3-random`, `8x8-N4`, and `16x16-N8`. A profile is selected by the Host
before a Run and contributes to the environment digest.

The spec defines the image axes, channel order, view orientation, compass and
symbolic encodings, obstacle update order, exact reward formula, and terminal
conditions. Feedback separates ball collisions from wall collisions and
records which Policy-visible object was ahead before every Action. It also
reports first-seen steps for the goal and obstacles, obstacle exposure,
remaining horizon, observation novelty, ineffective Actions, per-Action
usage, success, timeout, and Policy failures. `trace.jsonl` contains a bounded
semantic trace for at most four Episodes, retaining the first 128 and last 32
transitions of long Episodes. It contains no Episode seed, private Case
identity, or Host path.

The packaged baseline builds a relative map from public observations and
replans each step. It moves forward only when no currently visible obstacle
can enter the destination in one upstream motion update. It consumes no
private environment state.

Tests that use `ProcessExecution.unsafe()` run trusted packaged code only.
That backend is a local process mechanism, not a sandbox and not suitable for
hostile Programs.
