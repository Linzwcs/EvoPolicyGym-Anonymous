# BabyAI Benchmark Families

An independently installable EvoPolicyGym distribution covering the 40
requested BabyAI tasks. Profiles are grouped into five Benchmark identities:
`GoTo`, `Open`, `PickupPut`, `Unlock`, and `Composite`.

```python
from minigrid_babyai import BabyAIBenchmark, BabyAIConfig

benchmark = BabyAIBenchmark(
    BabyAIConfig(profile="BossLevel")
)
```

The Host selects the profile before a Run. The profile and family are visible
to the Agent, fixed for the Run, and included in the environment digest.
The primary metric is mean upstream Episode return, which rewards successful
completion and the upstream time efficiency bonus. Success rate remains a
separately reported task-completion outcome.
Upstream-generated natural-language missions remain part of the public
observation; Episode seeds and private identity never enter Feedback.
Every Episode is procedurally generated from its private seed. Composite
profiles can choose an actual task horizon below their advertised profile
maximum; per-step Feedback reports the exact remaining budget. The selected
non-debug profiles end naturally only after verified success. Wrong and
out-of-order actions normally continue, so traces distinguish successful and
failed pickup/drop/toggle attempts, door and box state changes, carried/front
objects, discovery, blocked movement, observation novelty, and timeouts.
Long traces retain the first 128 and final 32 transitions; Feedback and each
Episode trace row explicitly report the retained and omitted coverage. Each
traced observation also lists visible objects with their color and state.

The packaged initial Program is a public-observation exploration baseline. It
opens ordinary doors and clears movable blockers, but deliberately does not
encode BabyAI's full instruction grammar; the Benchmark is intended for Agent
policy development.

Tests using `ProcessExecution.unsafe()` execute trusted packaged code only.
That process backend is not a sandbox.
