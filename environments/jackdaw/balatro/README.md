# EvoPolicyGym Balatro Benchmark

This directory contains an unofficial, independently installable Balatro
Benchmark for EvoPolicyGym. It uses Jackdaw as the trusted headless rules
engine and exposes a semantic `PolicyValue` interface intended for Programs
written by coding agents.

The first profile is deliberately narrow:

- Red Deck (`b_red`);
- White Stake (`stake=1`);
- one complete run per Episode;
- deterministic, split-scoped hidden seeds;
- one point per Blind actually cleared, with the total doubled on a win;
- zero score for a Policy failure.

For `N` Blinds actually cleared, an unwon Episode scores `N` and a won Episode
scores `2N`. Clearing all 24 Blinds and winning scores 48. Skipped Blinds do
not count toward `N`. Each Blind clear gives +1 transition reward; clearing
the winning Boss also adds a one-time bonus of `N`, so the transition rewards
sum to `2N`. The following cash-out does not award the win bonus again.

The profile is selected through a typed Benchmark constructor:

```python
from balatro import BalatroBenchmark, BalatroConfig

benchmark = BalatroBenchmark(
    BalatroConfig(deck="b_red", stake=1)
)
```

The current distribution accepts only this tested profile. Its deck, stake,
content profile, and engine revision are published through
`BenchmarkSpec.environment_parameters`, contribute to `environment_digest`,
and are delivered to every Policy in
`PolicyContext.environment_parameters`. They are no longer duplicated in
`EpisodeSpec.scenario`; Episodes contain only split-scoped hidden seeds.

The `jackdaw-active-content-v1` environment parameter excludes objects whose
effects are inactive in the pinned engine. Exclusion happens while
constructing the RNG-backed pool, before selection:

- Tags: `tag_rare`, `tag_uncommon`, and `tag_voucher`;
- Vouchers: `v_omen_globe`, `v_telescope`, `v_observatory`,
  `v_directors_cut`, and `v_retcon`.

The partially implemented `v_illusion` remains available with a tooltip that
describes only its active behavior. Working prerequisites such as Crystal Ball
and Magic Trick also remain available. The exact exclusions are machine-readable
in `BenchmarkSpec.metadata.excluded_content`. These restrictions were introduced
in `run-score-v2` and change seed-to-content trajectories relative to
`run-score-v1`. The current `run-score-v3` Benchmark ID retains those restrictions
and replaces the former fixed 1000-point win bonus with a doubling of cleared
Blinds. Its scores are not directly comparable with either earlier version.

Jackdaw is maintained as vendored source under `vendor/jackdaw/`. Its base is
commit `c84dca9227b40eb5f7ff9fd7cd78945aa07854ce`, the immutable head of
upstream [PR #1](https://github.com/TylerFlar/jackdaw-balatro/pull/1). On top
of that base, this copy absorbs the reviewed gameplay and RNG fixes from
upstream [PR #2](https://github.com/TylerFlar/jackdaw-balatro/pull/2),
[PR #5](https://github.com/TylerFlar/jackdaw-balatro/pull/5), and
[PR #6](https://github.com/TylerFlar/jackdaw-balatro/pull/6). The exact commit
stack and known remaining limitations are recorded in
`vendor/jackdaw/EVOPOLICYGYM_VENDOR.md`.

## Policy interface

Observations are semantic dictionaries rather than Jackdaw's 235-dimensional
RL tensor. They contain the current phase, public run progress and resources,
the Blind, hand, Jokers, consumables, shop, pack, draw-pile composition, poker
hand levels, and a `legal_actions` description.

The Benchmark specification embeds the stable core manual in
`metadata.policy_guide`: the run loop, Benchmark reward versus game dollars,
phase transitions, exact Action shapes, observation semantics, scoring,
economy, card modifiers, and win/loss conditions. Coding Agents receive this
guide in their Run instruction without receiving an unseen card catalog.

The source repository separately provides the
[`optimize-balatro-policy`](../../../skills/optimize-balatro-policy/) Agent
Skill. It is not part of this Benchmark distribution or `BenchmarkSpec`.
Select it explicitly with the Balatro script's repeatable
`--skill skills/optimize-balatro-policy` option. The Run freezes the complete
directory and exposes it read-only at
`workspace/skills/optimize-balatro-policy/`. It guides Policy-system
architecture, replay regression, evidence allocation, strategy development,
and final candidate handoff without adding hidden game state or entering the
Policy process.

Every currently visible Joker, Enhancement, Tarot, Planet, Spectral card,
Voucher, Booster, Blind, and skip Tag carries a version-pinned `rule` object
derived from the implemented Jackdaw behavior. Visible Edition and Seal names
refer to the exact definitions in the core guide:

```json
{
  "key": "j_jolly",
  "name": "Jolly Joker",
  "rule": {
    "summary": "Jolly Joker: +conditional Mult if hand contains Pair.",
    "parameters": {"effect": "Type Mult", "t_mult": 8, "type": "Pair"},
    "rarity": {"level": 1, "name": "Common"}
  }
}
```

Jokers whose tooltip changes with the round, such as Ancient Joker, Castle,
The Idol, and Mail-In Rebate, additionally expose the currently visible target
under `rule.visible_state`.

When a Blind is cleared, `round_earnings` exposes the human-visible cash-out
breakdown: `blind_dollar_reward`, unused-hand and discard bonuses, Joker
dollars, interest, rental cost, and `total_dollars`. The transition's
top-level `reward` remains the separate Benchmark reward.

A minimal decision looks like:

```python
if observation["phase"] == "blind_select":
    return {"kind": "select_blind"}

if observation["phase"] == "selecting_hand":
    return {
        "kind": "play_hand",
        "card_indices": [0, 2, 4],
    }
```

Actions are strict tagged objects. Unknown or missing fields, invalid entity
indices, duplicate card indices, illegal phases, and invalid consumable targets
raise `InvalidAction`; Actions are never repaired. Card selection order is
preserved because it can affect scoring.

## Feedback and replay

Feedback reports the objective score, win rate, mean Ante reached, mean Blinds
cleared, Policy failures, and the pinned engine revision. It also aggregates
action counts, played hand types, bought-card and pack-pick types, best hand
score, best Blind progress, final chip deficit, current and peak money, money
gained/spent, purchase cost, sale value, and termination outcomes. Bounded
per-Episode diagnostics retain these same signals so an authoring Agent can
separate weak hand selection, failed Blind scaling, and poor shop economy.
Policy failures still score zero, but their public progress before failure is
reported separately from that scored outcome.

`replay.jsonl` retains complete semantic replays in Episode order within a
15 MiB public-artifact budget. Aggregate Feedback and Episode summaries still
cover every requested Episode; `replay_episodes` and
`replay_episodes_omitted` report detailed replay coverage. Every retained
initial state and transition state is the complete observation that the Policy
actually received, including `deck`, `poker_hands`, owned `vouchers`, awarded
`tags`, and `legal_actions`, plus public-derived transition metrics. This lets a
Policy-authoring Agent reproduce its decision context without receiving
Environment or Policy seeds.

This headless distribution contains no official Balatro art, sprites, fonts,
or animation pipeline, so it does not pretend that a generated chart is a game
GIF. `replay.jsonl` is the authoritative visualizable artifact: an external
player may render only the semantic fields it needs without changing the
Benchmark or exposing hidden draw order.

For Episodes longer than 256 decisions, the replay retains the first 192 and
final 64 transitions so that both early setup and terminal outcomes remain
visible. Episode records and aggregate Feedback explicitly report retained and
omitted transition counts; the 15 MiB budget may additionally omit later whole
Episode replays.

Each transition's top-level `reward` is the Benchmark reward. A Blind's
spendable in-game payout is a separate `blind.dollar_reward` value.

## Development

From this directory:

```console
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv build .
```

`ProcessExecution` in the Evaluation test is explicitly unsafe and provides no
isolation. Its test Program is a trusted package fixture.

## Scope and attribution

This project is not affiliated with LocalThunk, Playstack, or the official
Balatro project. It includes no official card art, sprites, music, fonts, or
other game assets.

The rules engine is
[TylerFlar/jackdaw-balatro](https://github.com/TylerFlar/jackdaw-balatro),
licensed under MIT. Jackdaw describes itself as an alpha-quality 1:1 Python
reimplementation and supplies live-game validation tooling, but this Benchmark
does not claim exhaustive equivalence with every official Balatro version.
The vendored revision, our deterministic replay checks, and future live
conformance results together define the supported profile.
