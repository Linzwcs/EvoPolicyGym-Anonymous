# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Changed Balatro to `run-score-v3`: one point per Blind actually cleared,
  doubled on a win (24 cleared Blinds score 48), with Policy failures still
  scoring zero. Public rules and evidence tools use the new scoring contract.
- Added a first-party Qoder CLI integration with explicit model selection,
  optional reasoning effort, headless stream output, retained identity, and
  caller-controlled authentication and configuration environment variables.
- Added Crafter and Linux-targeted NLE NetHack Benchmark distributions,
  complete reversible training trajectories, and the NLE held-out experiment
  reference page.
- Added Benchmark-declared permanent/bulk Artifact retention, synchronized
  oldest-first eviction in Host and Agent views, complete-newest protection,
  Agent-owned `workspace/analysis/`, and `run-record/v7`.
- Retained Benchmark-defined aggregate Feedback content in Host-only
  Validation and Assessment reports without exposing Artifacts to the Agent.
- Renamed the reusable general-purpose Agent Skill from `use-evopolicygym` to
  `evopolicygym`, refocused it on caller-side Host and public SDK workflows,
  and split its setup, Evaluation, Run, provider, authoring, and diagnostic
  guidance for progressive loading.
- Expanded CI to test and build all 59 first-party Benchmark distributions,
  including the Gymnasium Classic Control, Toy Text, Box2D, and MuJoCo suites
  plus Balatro, and added a repository test that rejects unlisted Environment
  projects.
- Split the Host/operator `evopolicygym` executable from the Agent-facing
  `evopolicygym-session submit|finish` client without changing the
  `agent-session/v3` wire protocol.
- Added a deterministic, Host-owned indexed training Episode pool. Agents now
  select arbitrary singleton and half-open range unions through
  `agent-session/v3`; repeated indices preserve Episode and Policy seeds across
  Submissions while every use still creates fresh runtimes and consumes
  budget.
- Added `RunConfig.episode_pool_size`, indexed `SubmissionResult` and Feedback
  records, `evopolicygym/feedback/v2`, and `evopolicygym/run-record/v6`.
- Added first-class public Environment parameters to `BenchmarkSpec`, the
  `policy/v2` `PolicyContext`, Coding Agent tasks, Evaluation identity, and
  `run-record/v4`.
- Added a canonical Environment-parameter digest so direct Evaluations,
  Submissions, Validation, Assessment, and retained Runs cannot silently mix
  different configured tasks under one Benchmark ID.
- Added optional held-out final-Program Assessment with an independent seed
  domain, aggregate results, progress events, and run-record schema v3.
- Added `AssessmentConfig`, `AssessmentResult`, and the `assessment_failed`
  terminal reason without candidate fallback.
- Added atomic ordered candidate handoff through `agent-session/v2` and
  optional post-Agent server-side Validation with aggregate retained results.
- Added `ValidationConfig`, candidate and Validation fields on `RunResult`,
  the `validation_failed` terminal reason, and run-record schema v2.
- Added persisted Episode progress events, the public `RunObserver` contract,
  and a standard-library `ConsoleProgress` reporter.
- Made the per-Submission Episode cap optional; it now defaults to `None` so
  the Coding Agent can allocate the finite Run budget itself.
- Added explicit, immutable, content-addressed `AgentSkill` directory
  snapshots. Runs may compose multiple Skills under read-only
  `workspace/skills/`, and `run-record/v5` retains their names and digests
  without coupling them to `BenchmarkSpec` or Policy processes.
- Added required Codex `reasoning_effort` selection, deterministic CLI
  translation, and retention in the Agent identity.

## 0.3.0

- Replaced the superseded implementation with a small clean-slate Kernel.
- Added immutable Program snapshots and direct per-Episode Policy processes.
- Added bounded Program-Evolution Runs with Agent submissions and final
  selection.
- Added Benchmark-defined Feedback content and public Artifact publication.
- Added the first-party Codex integration for explicitly unsafe local process
  execution.
- Made `evaluation`, `run`, and `execution` cohesive public feature packages;
  removed their parallel private shadow packages and the global composition
  root.
- Added a provider-neutral `CodingAgent` task/invocation template and made
  Codex its first implementation.
- Organized independently installable Benchmark distributions under
  `environments/` and marked the Kernel package as typed for external authors.
- Removed the superseded 0.2 implementation and its experimental products from
  the active repository.
