# EvoPolicyGym Run diagnostics

Inspect generated Run data read-only. Do not repair a Run by hand and do not
copy Host logs into the Agent workspace.

`events.jsonl` is the persisted lifecycle sequence. `run.json` is the terminal
manifest and authoritative summary. A submission appears under `submissions/`
only after its Program and public Feedback commit successfully.

## Diagnose in order

1. Read `run.json`: benchmark ID, selected Skill names and digests, config,
   terminal reason, final submission, ordered candidates, published
   submissions, optional Validation and Assessment reports, and Agent exit.
2. Read the final events in `events.jsonl`: determine whether failure occurred
   before an Episode, during an Episode, after all Episodes, or during
   publication.
3. Inspect only the matching submission's public `feedback.json` and Artifact
   sizes.
4. Inspect `agent/stderr.log` and structured `agent/stdout.log` for provider or
   command failures. Treat these as Host-owned execution records.
5. Reproduce the smallest safe direct Evaluation only when the retained
   records do not identify the fault.

## Interpret common outcomes

- `finished`: the Agent handed off candidates and the Host selected a final
  published submission.
- `budget_exhausted`: no Episode authority remains without a successful
  selection.
- `agent_exited`: the Agent process exited before a terminal selection.
- `agent_failed`: the Agent could not start, timed out, or violated its process
  contract.
- `evaluation_failed`: trusted evaluation could not produce a valid result.
- `validation_failed`: post-Agent candidate Validation failed; no partial
  final selection or report is authoritative.
- `assessment_failed`: held-out Evaluation failed after final selection. The
  selected Program remains final, but there is no authoritative Assessment
  result or fallback candidate.

An Episode status of `policy_failed` is a scored Policy outcome, not a trusted
evaluation failure. Its failure code is one of `exception`, `timeout`,
`invalid_action`, or `protocol_error`.

If all requested Episodes completed and `evaluation_failed` follows
immediately, inspect `Benchmark.feedback()`, score validation, PolicyValue
conversion, and Artifact limits. If `publication_failed` appears, inspect Run
directory permissions, disk availability, serialization, and atomic file
commit behavior.

## Keep evidence boundaries intact

- Do not expose Agent logs, Host paths, seeds, Case identity, or execution
  evidence through Feedback.
- Do not reinterpret Environment or Backend faults as zero reward.
- Do not refund reserved Episode budget after a trusted evaluation failure.
- Do not infer that a missing submission directory means its Episodes did not
  execute; publication happens only after Evaluation and Feedback succeed.
- Remember that current local processes are not isolated even though the
  logical workspace and log views are separate.

Report the Run path, terminal reason, last committed lifecycle event, affected
Submission or Host phase, evidence inspected, classified failure domain,
probable cause, and the smallest safe reproduction. Do not mutate retained
records unless the user explicitly requests artifact repair.
